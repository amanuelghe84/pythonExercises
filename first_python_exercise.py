# 1. Define two variables, x and y, with values 5 and 10.
#    Perform the following operations and print the results:
#    a) Sum of x and y
#    b) Difference of y and x
#    c) Product of x and y
#    d) Quotient of y by x

x = 5
y = 10

z = 5 + 10
print(z)

d = 10 - 5
print(d)

p = 5 * 10
print(p)

q = 10/5
print(q)


# 2. Define a list of fruits containing "apple", "banana", and "cherry".
#    a) Add "orange" to the list.
#    b) Remove "banana" from the list.
#    c) Print the first and last elements of the list.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

fruits.append("orange")

print(fruits)

fruits.remove("banana")

print(fruits)

print(fruits[0],fruits[2])


# 3. Define a set of numbers containing 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
#    a) Add the number 6 to the set.
#    b) Remove the number 3 from the set.
#    c) Check if the numbers 5 and 7 are in the set, and print the results.

numbers_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

numbers_set.add(6)

print(numbers_set)

numbers_set.remove(3)

print(numbers_set)



# 4. Define a tuple representing coordinates (10.5, 20.7).
#    a) Print the x (first) and y (second) coordinates separately.

coordinates = (10.5, 20.7)

x_coordinates, y_coordinates = (10.5, 20.7)

print(x_coordinates)

print(y_coordinates)


# 5. Define a dictionary of student grades, where:
#    - "Alice" has a grade of 85
#    - "Bob" has a grade of 90
#    - "Charlie" has a grade of 78
#    a) Add a new student "David" with a grade of 88.
#    b) Update Alice's grade to 95.
#    c) Print Bob's grade.

grades = {"Alice": 85, "Bob": 90, "Charlie": 78}

grades.append({"David": 88})

print(grades)



 

# 6. Define a variable called `age` with a value of 18.
#    a) Write an if/else statement that checks if the age is 18 or above. 
#    If true, print "You are eligible to vote", otherwise print "You are not eligible to vote".

age = 18

# 7. Define a list of fruits: ["apple", "orange", "grape"].
#    a) Use a `for` loop to print each fruit in the list.

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "grape"]

# 8. Define a variable `count` with a value of 5.
#    a) Use a `while` loop to print a countdown from 5 to 1.

count = 5

# 9. Challenge: Combine lists, sets, dictionaries, and loops.
#    a) Define a list of numbers from 1 to 10.
#    b) Create a set of even numbers from the list using a `for` loop or comprehension.
#    c) Create a dictionary that maps each even number to its square.
#    d) Print the set of even numbers and the dictionary.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


# 10. Conversion between List, Set, and Tuple
#     a) Convert the list of fruits to a set and print the result.
#     b) Convert the set of even numbers to a tuple and print the result.
#     c) Convert the tuple of coordinates to a list and print the result.

# Conversion between list, set, and tuple examples:
# fruits -> set
# even_numbers (from challenge) -> tuple
# coordinates (tuple) -> list

# 11. Dictionary Keys and Values
#     a) Print the list of dictionary keys from the `grades` dictionary.
#     b) Print the list of dictionary values from the `grades` dictionary.
#     c) Loop through the dictionary and print each student name (key) and their grade (value).

# Dictionary keys and values
# grades -> keys() -> list
# grades -> values() -> list
# loop through dictionary
